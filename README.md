# metro_redux_launcher
A simple script to run the Metro 2033 and Last Light Redux avoiding the Steam auto update if there are modified files in the game.

I created this one line code only to go through the auto update of the game on Steam that was downloading again the files modified by the Brazilian Portuguese translation of TriboGamer whenever I started the game.

It simply starts an encapsulated process at another runtime avoiding auto update.

# Requeriments
* Windows 7 or higher
* Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6

# Installing
The program has no installer, just open the executable "metro_redux_launcher.exe".

NOTE: If the Steam is running in administrator mode, the program should also be started in administrator mode.

# Usage
Copy the executable to the folder of Metro 2033 Redux or Metro Last Light Redux and always launch the game through the launcher. You can create shortcuts if you want but the executable must be inside the game folder!

NOTE: Steam must be open to play, if not, it will automatically open due to the protocols of the games themselves.
